# http-sync
This is for the game [Stormworks](https://store.steampowered.com/app/573090/).


# Usage

1) Start with
```
npm start
```
2) Port forward port 31235 (If can't then skip this step and use Ngrok in app)
3) Go to `https://localhost:31234` in your browser
4) Profit!

# NOTE
Minimal setup is the host/server and the user. This **WILL** cause visual desync between players thus, If possible. everyone should have this running, and connected but it will work with just host and you
